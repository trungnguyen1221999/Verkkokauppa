# 🛒 Verkkokauppa.com Frontend Clone

## 📖 Overview
This project is a **frontend clone** of [Verkkokauppa.com](https://www.verkkokauppa.com) – the largest e-commerce website in Finland.  
The goal of this project is to practice building and structuring a **large-scale e-commerce frontend** using **React** and **styled-components**.  

Currently, only the **homepage** has been implemented, and I will continue to expand and improve the website over time.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- ⚛️ **React** – component-based UI development  
- 💅 **Styled Components** – modern CSS-in-JS styling solution  
- 📂 **Data Files** – mock data for rendering components  
- 🛠️ **Reusable Functions** – each component is generated by functions and rendered by passing data  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
- Components are created as reusable functions.  
- Data is stored separately in dedicated `.js` files for better management.  
- To render a UI section, simply call the component function and pass the required data.  

Example:
```jsx
const LatestBlogsSlide = () => {
  return (
    <>
      {createBlogSlide({
        data: LatestBlogsData,
        heading: "Latest articles",
        btn: "Read more",
      })}
    </>
  );
};
